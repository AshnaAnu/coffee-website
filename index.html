            <p id="about-coffee-para">Coffee, a ubiquitous beverage enjoyed by millions around the world, boasts a rich
                history, diverse
                brewing
                methods, and a complex interplay of flavors and aromas. From its humble origins in Ethiopia to its role
                as a
                cultural staple in many societies, coffee has become more than just a drink—it is a social lubricant, a
                morning ritual, and a subject of scientific study.

                Historical Background

                The legend of coffee's discovery dates back to the 9th century in Ethiopia, where a goat herder named
                Kaldi
                observed his goats becoming unusually energetic after eating berries from a certain tree. Intrigued,
                Kaldi
                tried the berries himself and experienced a similar burst of energy. This discovery eventually reached
                the
                Arabian Peninsula, where coffee cultivation and trade began. By the 15th century, coffee was being grown
                in
                Yemen and consumed in Persia, Egypt, and Turkey.

                Coffeehouses, known as "qahveh khaneh," became popular in the Middle East, serving as centers for social
                interaction, intellectual exchange, and business transactions. These establishments spread to Europe in
                the
                17th century, starting in Venice and quickly proliferating in major cities like Paris, Vienna, and
                London.
                European colonists later introduced coffee to the Americas, where it thrived in the tropical climates of
                the
                Caribbean, Central America, and South America.</p>

                    Arabica coffee beans are the most popular beans in the world, and there is evidence of Arabica plant
                    growth over 3,000 years ago.

                    Arabica beans are larger, sweeter, and more expensive than their prime competition, the Robusta. The
                    added expense is because Arabica beans are harder to grow, needing more water, shade, and higher
                    altitudes than the Robusta.

                    Brazil is the leading producer of Arabica beans which typically grow at elevations between 500 and
                    2500
                    meters. They are not, however native to Brazil. Arabica beans are thought to have originated in
                    Ethiopia. Their name comes from their use on the Arabian Peninsula, present day Saudi Arabia and
                    Yemen,
                    in the 7th Century.</p>

                    Robusta beans make up almost 40% of worldwide exports, and are grown in many of the same areas as
                    Arabica beans to include much of Africa, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Their origin of Robusta beans is
                    African.

                    Robusta beans have a lower acidity than Arabica making them less sweet and the type most often used
                    in
                    espresso and in instant coffee. Robusta beans have almost double the caffeine content of Arabica
                    beans
                    and are known for a stronger and more bitter taste and smell.</p>

                    Liberica coffee is a less common species originally from the African country Liberia.

                    Librica coffee plants are highly tolerant of tropical climates and lower altitudes, so they grow
                    well
                    across Southeast Asia in places like Indonesia and the Philippines.Liberica coffee beans have a
                    distinctive oval shape with uneven sides and are larger than typical coffee beans.

                    The Liberica plant itself is impressively tall, growing up to 60 feet high like a tree, unlike other
                    coffee species that are more shrub-like. While not as widely consumed as Arabica and Robusta,
                    Liberica
                    is still appreciated by some coffee lovers for its unique flavor profile.</p>

                    species until 2005. After that, it was reclassified as a sub-variety of Coffea Liberica called
                    Dewevrei.

                    Excelsa beans have the least caffeine of all coffee types. It’s usually grown in Southeast Asia and
                    added to blends to impart its exotic tarty flavors.The Excelsa coffee bean is much smaller and

                    can reach up to 50 feet tall. </p>
